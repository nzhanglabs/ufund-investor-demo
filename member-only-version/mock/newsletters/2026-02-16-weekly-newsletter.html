      <h1>Office-to-Residential Conversion Activity and Constraints</h1>
      <div class="byline">Real Estate Industry Brief</div>

      <h2>Market Context</h2>
      <p>Commercial real estate activity remains selective as capital providers prioritize asset quality, sponsor track record, and cash-flow durability. Transaction pacing is improving in targeted submarkets, but buyers and sellers are still calibrating around financing costs and forward rent expectations.</p>
      <p>Across major metros, price discovery is more active in sectors with clear demand visibility, while assets with near-term lease rollover or capex uncertainty continue to see wider bid-ask ranges.</p>

      <h2>What We Are Seeing This Week</h2>
      <p>In current market dialogue, operators are emphasizing operational execution over headline growth assumptions. Leasing velocity, renewal retention, and expense control are carrying more weight in valuation conversations than top-line projections alone.</p>
      <p>For stabilized properties, underwriting is increasingly anchored to in-place performance. For transitional opportunities, sponsors are expected to show conservative timelines and contingency planning before lenders and equity partners engage at scale.</p>

      <h2>Forward View</h2>
      <p>Near-term direction likely depends on debt-market stability, labor conditions, and sector-specific supply pipelines. Industrial and essential-use retail remain comparatively resilient in many corridors, while multifamily outcomes vary by local supply pressure and household formation trends.</p>
      <p>Over the next several weeks, market participants will continue to watch refinancing windows, operating margin trends, and liquidity depth for quality assets.</p>
